# Drupal 7 Puppet Module

Drupal is a complex content management framework and requires a lot of time to install and
configure by hand. To save our clients time and money, New Media Campaigns uses
Vagrant and Puppet to automate Drupal website installation and configuration. This repository
contains our Drupal 7 Puppet module.
